Hello Github ðŸ˜Ž

I believe in the beauty and diversity of the world. Everything I do is to enjoy every piece of it. In doing so, I choose to live a simple and intentional life. I love the work and colleagues I work with, I consume only the things I need, live without clutter and burden to the past. Then contribute to society in a useful way.

My name is David Adi Nugroho and I am a self-taught Software Developer.
